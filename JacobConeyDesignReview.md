|Item |Considerations| Comments/Suggestions|
|--------|---------|---|
|||Reviewer comments and suggestions go here. Each item should have *at least* one "kudos" and two suggestions for improvement|
|**Problem Statement**|1. Accurately describes project purpose<br> 2. Is professional and free of typos, slang, etc.<br> 3. Fully explains the problem and the solution<br> 4. Is understandable by the average person| 1. Your problem statement is reasonable and this is a nice idea. <br> 2. I can image me cook somethings with this web application in my kitchen|
|**Design Documentation**|1. Navigation/flow through the application is logical and easy to use. <br>2. The order in which values are displayed are logical and easy to understand/use <br>3. The order in which the form fields entered are logical and easy to understand/use<br>4. All data discussed/documented (problem statement, flow, db design, etc.) is represented on the screens | 1. The flow in you project is good following the UXUI that you showed me. <br>2. I like the idea that users can go to the next page by speaking<br>Suggestion: <br>3. for the step page. I think the description should be short and big, so it will be easy for users to read is quickly.<br>4. I think you can combine the ingredients with the instructions in Step by step page, so users don't need to click to see ingredients icon.<br> For example: Add a cup of milk and 20 gram of sugar.| 
|**Data model/Database**|1. Everything on the  screens and problem statement/flow is represented in the model <br> 2. There is at least one 1-to-many relationship.<br> 3. The model represents good database design <br>| I don't see any database in your project. |
|**Code**|1. Proper Maven project structure is used<br> 2. a .gitignore file for IntelliJ Java projects has been implemented <br> 3. There is not any redundant or copy/paste code in the JSPs or classes<br> 4. Classes are appropriately-sized (no monster classes)<br> Property files are used appropriately: no hard-coded values <br> 5. Logging statements are used rather than System.out.println and printStackTrace.<br> 6. There are appropriate unit tests/code coverages.  |Good:<br>1. You already started the individual project and have most of main class in the right directory. <br><br>Suggestion <br> 1. You have unit tests for Image and Users Class. That is good. <br>2. I the userDao Class. You might need to get rid of it.<br> 3. Don't forget controller class|<br>4. It seems you didn't update gitignore since last month. <br>
